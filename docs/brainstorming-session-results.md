## Technique Sessions

### Technique 1: "What If Scenarios" - 10 minutes

**Description:** Explored provocative "what if" scenarios to spark creative possibilities for the voice AI game

#### Ideas Generated:
1. **Emotion Recognition AI** - Peppa detects sad vs. happy voice tones and responds appropriately
2. **Memory & Continuity** - Peppa remembers previous conversations and references them later
3. **Adaptive Learning** - Real-time difficulty adjustment based on daughter's engagement and understanding
4. **Personalized Storytelling** - Creates stories using daughter's name, favorite toys, and daily experiences
5. **Routine Guidance** - Peppa guides through daily activities like tooth brushing with songs and encouragement

#### Insights Discovered:
- Voice tone detection could create deeper emotional connection than words alone
- Memory functionality creates the illusion of a "real friend" rather than a program
- Adaptive learning is crucial for maintaining engagement across different energy/attention levels
- Personalization transforms generic content into magical, meaningful experiences

#### Notable Connections:
- Emotion recognition + adaptive learning creates a self-regulating educational system
- Memory + personalized storytelling builds ongoing narrative and relationship depth

### Technique 2: "Five Whys" - 8 minutes

**Description:** Uncovered deeper motivations through iterative "why" questioning

#### Ideas Generated:
1. **Bilingual Education Tool** - Core purpose is teaching English to Mandarin-speaking child
2. **Joyful Learning** - Making English practice exciting rather than boring traditional methods
3. **Early Advantage** - Giving daughter confidence and language skills at critical developmental age
4. **Screen Time Transformation** - Converting passive watching into active skill-building

#### Insights Discovered:
- This isn't just entertainment - it's strategic educational investment

### Technique 3: "Role Playing" - 12 minutes

**Description:** Explored the experience from three key perspectives to ensure holistic design

#### Ideas Generated:
1. **3-Year-Old's Perspective** - Waving animation + simple conversations = magical connection
2. **Peppa Pig's Perspective** - Learn friend's name + use easy words + cheerful tone = engaging experience
3. **Technical Reality** - Client-server architecture with voice AI integration is achievable in 2 weeks

#### Insights Discovered:
- Simple visual cues (waving) are crucial for 3-year-old engagement
- Age-appropriate vocabulary and Peppa's authentic tone are essential for believability
- Technical priorities should be voice interaction first, animation second given timeline
- Core architecture must support real-time voice processing for conversational flow

#### Notable Connections:
- The technical solution must serve the emotional and developmental needs first
- Balancing technical constraints with magical experience requires smart prioritization
